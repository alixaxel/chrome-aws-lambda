    Set to true to enable the clang plugin that checks the usage of the  Blink
    garbage-collection infrastructure during compilation.

blink_gc_plugin_option_do_dump_graph
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/blink/renderer/BUILD.gn:21

    Set to true to have the clang Blink GC plugin emit class graph (in JSON)
    with typed pointer edges; for debugging or other (internal) uses.

blink_gc_plugin_option_warn_unneeded_finalizer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/blink/renderer/BUILD.gn:26

    Set to true to have the clang Blink GC plugin additionally check if

    Overridden from the default = -1
      From //third_party/blink/renderer/config.gni:36

    How many symbols to include in the build of blink. This affects
    the performance of the build since the symbols are large and dealing with
    them is slow.
      2 means regular build with symbols.
      1 means minimal symbols, usually enough for backtraces only. Symbols with
    internal linkage (static functions or those in anonymous namespaces) may not
    appear when using this level.

build_libsrtp_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libsrtp/BUILD.gn:10

    Tests may not be appropriate for some build environments, e.g. Windows.
    Rather than enumerate valid options, we just let clients ask for them.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:16

    If true, IS_CAST_DEBUG_BUILD() will evaluate to 1 in version.h. Otherwise,
    it will evaluate to 0. Overriding this when is_debug=false is useful for
    doing engineering builds.

cc_wrapper
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/toolchain/cc_wrapper.gni:36

    Set to "ccache", "icecc" or "distcc".  Probably doesn't work on windows.

      From //build/config/clang/clang.gni:14

clang_sample_profile_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:101

    Path to an AFDO profile to use while building with clang, if any. Empty
    implies none.

    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/clang/clang.gni:12

    Indicates if the build should use the Chrome-specific plugins for enforcing
    coding guidelines, etc. Only used when compiling with Clang.

clang_use_default_sample_profile
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:109

    Some configurations have default sample profiles. If this is true and
    clang_sample_profile_path is empty, we'll fall back to the default.

    We currently only have default profiles for Chromium in-tree, so we disable
    this by default for all downstream projects, since these profiles are likely
    nonsensical for said projects.

clang_version
    Current value (from the default) = "9.0.0"
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:45

    Clang compiler version. Clang files are placed at version-dependent paths.

compute_build_timestamp
    Current value (from the default) = "compute_build_timestamp.py"
      From //build/timestamp.gni:17

    This should be the filename of a script that prints a single line
    containing an integer that's a unix timestamp in UTC.
    This timestamp is used as build time and will be compiled into
    other code.

    This argument may look unused. Before removing please check with the
    chromecast team to see if they still use it internally.

compute_inputs_for_analyze
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compute_inputs_for_analyze.gni:13

    Enable this flag when running "gn analyze".

    This causes some gn actions to compute inputs immediately (via exec_script)
    where they would normally compute them only when executed (and write them to
    a depfile).

    This flag will slow down GN, but is required for analyze to work properly.

concurrent_links
    Current value (from the default) = -1
      From //build/toolchain/concurrent_links.gni:19

    Limit the number of concurrent links; we often want to run fewer
    links at once than we do compiles, because linking is memory-intensive.
    The default to use varies by platform and by the amount of memory
    available, so we call out to a script to get the right value.

content_shell_major_version
    Current value (from the default) = "99"
      From //content/shell/BUILD.gn:29

content_shell_product_name

coverage_instrumentation_input_file
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/coverage/coverage.gni:22

    The path to the coverage instrumentation input file should be a source root
    absolute path (e.g. //out/Release/coverage_instrumentation_input.txt), and
    the file consists of multiple lines where each line represents a path to a
    source file, and the paths must be relative to the root build directory.
    e.g. ../../base/task/post_task.cc for build directory 'out/Release'.

crashpad_dependencies
    Current value = "chromium"
      From //.gn:64
    Overridden from the default = "standalone"
      From //third_party/crashpad/crashpad/build/crashpad_buildconfig.gni:19

    Determines various flavors of build configuration, and which concrete
    targets to use for dependencies. Valid values are "standalone", "chromium",
    "fuchsia", "dart" or "external".

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/crashpad/crashpad/util/net/tls.gni:21

    TODO(scottmg): https://crbug.com/crashpad/266 fuchsia:DX-690: BoringSSL
    was removed from the Fuchsia SDK. Re-enable it when we have a way to acquire
    a BoringSSL lib again.

    Current value (from the default) = ""
      (Internally set; try `gn help current_cpu`.)

current_os
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      (Internally set; try `gn help current_os`.)

custom_toolchain
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:144

    Allows the path to a custom target toolchain to be injected as a single
    argument, and set as the default toolchain.

      From //third_party/dawn/scripts/dawn_features.gni:22

    Should the Dawn static libraries be fully linked vs. GN's default of
    treating them as source sets. This is useful for people using Dawn
    standalone to produce static libraries to use in their projects.

      From //build/config/dcheck_always_on.gni:14

    Set to true to enable dcheck in Release builds.

dcheck_is_configurable
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/dcheck_always_on.gni:9

    Enables DCHECKs to be built-in, but to default to being non-fatal/log-only.
    DCHECKS can then be set as fatal/non-fatal via the DCheckIsFatal feature.
    See crbug.com/596231 for details on how this is used.

debug_devtools
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/blink/public/public_features.gni:12

    If debug_devtools is set to true, JavaScript files for DevTools are stored
    as is and loaded from disk. Otherwise, a concatenated file is stored in

    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:134

    On Android, FFMpeg is built without video decoders by default.
    This flag gives the option to override that decision in case there are no
    hardware decoders. To do so, you will also need to update ffmpeg build files
    in order to define which decoders to build in.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:67

    Compile in such a way as to make it possible for the profiler to unwind full
    stack frames. Setting this flag has a large effect on the performance of the
    generated code than just setting profiling, but gives the profiler more
    information to analyze.
    Requires profiling to be set to true.

enable_gpu_client_logging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //gpu/command_buffer/client/BUILD.gn:9

    Enable GPU client logging without DCHECK being on.

    Whether service side logging (actual calls into the GL driver) is enabled
    or not.

enable_gvr_services
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:11

    Is GWP-ASan malloc() hooking enabled for chrome/ on a given platform.

enable_hangout_services_extension
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:37

    Hangout services is an extension that adds extra features to Hangouts.
    It is enableable separately to facilitate testing.

enable_hevc_demuxing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:73

    Enable HEVC/H265 demuxing. Actual decoding must be provided by the
    platform. Enable by default for Chromecast.

enable_hls_sample_aes
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:81

    Enable HLS with SAMPLE-AES decryption.

enable_internal_app_remoting_targets
    Current value (from the default) = false

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ipc/features.gni:7

    Enabling debug builds automatically sets enable_ipc_logging to true.

enable_isolated_xr_service
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:49

enable_iterator_debugging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/BUILD.gn:37

    When set (the default) enables C++ iterator debugging in debug builds.
    Iterator debugging is always off in release builds (technically, this flag
    affects the "debug" config, which is always available but applied by
    default only in debug builds).

    Iterator debugging is generally useful for catching bugs. But it can
    introduce extra locking to check the state of an iterator against the state
    of the current object. For iterator- and thread-heavy code, this can
    significantly slow execution - two orders of magnitude slowdown has been
    seen (crbug.com/903553) and iterator debugging also slows builds by making
    generation of snapshot_blob.bin take ~40-60 s longer. Therefore this
    defaults to off.

enable_keystone_registration_framework
    Current value = false
      From //out/Headless/args.gn:9
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //chrome/BUILD.gn:51

    Indicates whether keystone registration framework should be enabled (see
    action("keystone_registration_framework") below).  There are some tests
    where we'd like for it to be disabled. (https://crbug.com/909080)

    Overridden from the default = true
      From //chrome/installer/BUILD.gn:11

enable_location_source
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //base/BUILD.gn:45

    Indicates if the Location object contains the source code information
    (file, function, line). False means only the program counter (and currently
    file name) is saved.

enable_logging_override
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:86

    Enable logging override, e.g. enable DVLOGs at build time. Must not be
    enabled when |use_jumbo_build| is true, in which case multiple .cc files
    are combined and we could override more logging than expected.

enable_mdns
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:29

    Multicast DNS.

enable_media_remoting
    Current value = false
      From //out/Headless/args.gn:11
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:258

    This switch defines whether the Media Remoting implementation will be built.
    When enabled, media is allowed to be renderer and played back on remote
    devices when the tab is being casted and other conditions are met.

enable_media_remoting_rpc
    Current value = false
      From //out/Headless/args.gn:12
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:264

    Media Remoting RPC is disabled on Android since it's unused but increases
    the native binary size by ~70Kb.

enable_media_router_jscompile
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/browser/resources/media_router/extension/BUILD.gn:12

    Determines whether JSCompiler should be used to typecheck
    JavaScript code for the Media Router extension.

enable_message_center
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //ui/base/ui_features.gni:15

      From //mojo/public/cpp/bindings/BUILD.gn:10

enable_mojom_closure_compile
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:41

    Enables Closure compilation of generated JS lite bindings. In environments
    where compilation is supported, any mojom target "foo" will also have a
    corresponding "foo_js_library_for_compile" target generated.

enable_mojom_message_id_scrambling
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:36

    Controls message ID scrambling behavior. If |true|, message IDs are
    scrambled (i.e. randomized based on the contents of //chrome/VERSION) on
    non-Chrome OS desktop platforms. Set to |false| to disable message ID
    scrambling on all platforms.

enable_mojom_typemapping
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:30

    Indicates whether typemapping should be supported in this build
    configuration. This may be disabled when building external projects which
    depend on //mojo but which do not need/want all of the Chromium tree
    dependencies that come with typemapping.

    Note that (perhaps obviously) a huge amount of Chromium code will not build
    with typemapping disabled, so it is never valid to set this to |false| in
    any Chromium build configuration.

enable_mpeg_h_audio_demuxing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:61

enable_mse_mpeg2ts_stream_parser
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:64

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/views/features.gni:10

    Whether we should draw the minimize, maximize/restore, and close
    buttons using the system theme.  Only used on Linux.

enable_nocompile_tests
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/nocompile.gni:64

enable_oculus_vr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:21

    To build with Oculus support, the Oculus SDK for Windows will need to be
    installed in third_party/libovr/src.  See
    third_party/libovr/README.chromium for details.

enable_offline_pages
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/offline_pages/buildflags/features.gni:8

    Whether to enable OfflinePages support. Currently user-visible features
    are Android-only.

      From //components/offline_pages/buildflags/features.gni:12

    This enables test API for locally-built harness which is used for quality
    evaluations. Requires setting this variable manually at local environment.

enable_one_click_signin
    Current value = false
      From //out/Headless/args.gn:14
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:44

enable_pdf
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //pdf/features.gni:12

enable_plugins
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //ppapi/buildflags/buildflags.gni:10

enable_precompiled_headers
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/pch.gni:11

    Precompiled header file support is by default available,
    but for distributed build system uses (like goma) or when
    doing official builds.

enable_print_preview
    Current value = false
      From //build/args/headless.gn:33
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //printing/buildflags/buildflags.gni:17

    Enable printing with print preview. It implies enable_basic_printing.
    Note: It would be convenient to not repeat many of the same conditions in
    enable_basic_printing below. However, GN does not allow the use of
    enable_basic_printing within the same declare_args() block.

enable_profiling
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:44

    Compile in such a way as to enable profiling of the generated code. For
    example, don't omit the frame pointer and leave in symbols.

enable_random_mojo_delays
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //mojo/public/cpp/bindings/BUILD.gn:16

    enable_random_mojo_delays starts a task runner that periodically pauses
    random Mojo bindings and later resumes them, in order to test whether parts
    of the code implicitly rely on FIFO processing of messages sent on different
    message pipes (which they should not).

enable_reading_list
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //components/reading_list/features/reading_list.gni:8

    Controls whether reading list support is active or not. Currently only
    supported on iOS (on other platforms, the feature is always disabled).

enable_remote_navigable_contents_view
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //services/content/public/features.gni:17

    Determines whether or not the Content Service should support remote
    (i.e., out-of-process) clients embedding NavigableContentsViews within their
    UI. If this is false, only clients in the same process as the Content
    Service may use NavigableContentsView.

    Currently only supported on Chrome OS, where |toolkit_views| is implied and
    the UI service (i.e. Mus) is available.

enable_remoting
    Current value = false
      From //build/args/headless.gn:34
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //remoting/remoting_enable.gni:12

enable_remoting_jscompile

      From //net/features.gni:32

    Reporting not used on iOS.

enable_resource_whitelist_generation
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/gcc_toolchain.gni:27

enable_runtime_media_renderer_selection
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:161

    When enabled, this feature allows developers to use a runtime flag to
    choose the implementation of the renderer that is used. On a build which
    enables the mojo renderer, if --disable-mojo-renderer is passed at start-up,
    the "default" renderer will be used instead. Both renderer implementations
    will be linked if this feature is enabled, increasing the binary size. This
    feature does not make sense if the mojo renderer is not enabled.

enable_service_discovery
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:46

enable_session_service
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:50

    Enables use of the session service, which is enabled by default.
    Android stores them separately on the Java side.

enable_simple_browser_service_in_process
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:56

enable_simple_browser_service_out_of_process
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:58

enable_supervised_users
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:60

enable_swiftshader
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //ui/gl/BUILD.gn:15

enable_test_mojo_media_client
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:153

    Enable the TestMojoMediaClient to be used in mojo MediaService. This is for
    testing only and will override the default platform MojoMediaClient, if any.

enable_vr
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:29

enable_vulkan
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //gpu/vulkan/features.gni:11

    Enable experimental vulkan backend.

enable_wayland_server
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:63

    Indicates if Wayland display server support is enabled.

enable_websockets
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:16

    WebSockets and socket stream code are not used on iOS and are optional in
    cronet.

enable_widevine
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/widevine/cdm/widevine.gni:13

    Enables Widevine key system support. Enabled by default in Google Chrome and
    on Android.
    Can be optionally enabled in Chromium on non-Android platforms. Please see
    //src/third_party/widevine/LICENSE file for details.

enable_wifi_display
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //extensions/buildflags/buildflags.gni:12

    Enables Wi-Fi Display functionality
    WARNING: This enables MPEG Transport Stream (MPEG-TS) encoding!

enable_windows_mr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:16

fatal_linker_warnings
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:83

    Enable fatal linker warnings. Building Chromium with certain versions
    of binutils can cause linker warning.
    See: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=457359

ffmpeg_branding
    Current value = "Chrome"
      From //out/Headless/args.gn:15
    Overridden from the default = "Chromium"
      From //third_party/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_options.gni:34

    Controls whether we build the Chromium or Google Chrome version of FFmpeg.
    The Google Chrome version contains additional codecs. Typical values are
    Chromium, Chrome, and ChromeOS.

ffmpeg_use_atomics_fallback
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_options.gni:51

    Set to true to force the use of ffmpeg's stdatomic fallback code.

    Windows and GCC prior to 4.9 lack stdatomic.h.

    This is also useful for developers who use icecc, which relies upon
    clang's -frewrite-includes flag which is broken with #include_next
    directives as used in chromium's clang stdatomic.h.
    Some background: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26828

fieldtrial_testing_like_official_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //components/variations/service/BUILD.gn:14

    Set to true make a build that disables activation of field trial tests
    specified in testing/variations/fieldtrial_testing_config.json.
    Note: this setting is ignored if is_chrome_branded.
    TODO(thakis): It's strange this is called "_like_official_build" but then
    checks is_chrome_branded, not is_official_build.

force_local_build_id
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:135

    By default only the binaries in official builds get build IDs.

full_wpo_on_official
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:167

gcc_target_rpath
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/gcc/BUILD.gn:19

    When non empty, overrides the target rpath value. This allows a user to
    make a Chromium build where binaries and shared libraries are meant to be
    installed into separate directories, like /usr/bin/chromium and
    /usr/lib/chromium for instance. It is useful when a build system that
    generates a whole target root filesystem (like Yocto) is used on top of gn,
    especially when cross-compiling.
    Note: this gn arg is similar to gyp target_rpath generator flag.

generate_linker_map
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:26

    Used for binary size analysis.

generate_order_files
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chrome_build.gni:17

    Turn this on to generate order files. See
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/win_order_files.md

gold_path
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:71

    When we are going to use gold we need to find it.
    This is initialized below, after use_gold might have been overridden.

goma_dir
    Current value (from the default) = "/root/goma"
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:26

    Absolute directory containing the gomacc binary.

google_api_key
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:46

    Set these to bake the specified API keys and OAuth client
    IDs/secrets into your build.

    If you create a build without values baked in, you can instead
    set environment variables to provide the keys at runtime (see
    src/google_apis/google_api_keys.h for details).  Features that
    require server-side APIs may fail to work if no keys are
    provided.

    Note that if you are building an official build or if
    use_official_google_api_keys has been set to trie (explicitly or
    implicitly), these values will be ignored and the official
    keys will be used instead.

google_default_client_id
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:49

    See google_api_key.

google_default_client_secret
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:52

    See google_api_key.

gtest_enable_absl_printers
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/googletest/BUILD.gn:9

    If true, it assumes that //third_party/abseil-cpp is an available dependency.

gtk_version
    Current value (from the default) = 3
      From //build/config/linux/gtk/gtk.gni:7

    The (major) version of GTK to build against.

has_gomacc_path
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:14

    This flag is for ChromeOS compiler wrapper.
    By passing gomacc path via GOMACC_PATH environment variable, ChromeOS'
    compiler wrapper invokes gomacc inside it.

has_native_accessibility
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/base/ui_features.gni:12

    Whether the platform provides a native accessibility toolkit.

headless_fontconfig_utils
    Current value = true
      From //build/args/headless.gn:19
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //headless/headless.gni:10

    Provide bindings for font loading for headless embedders.

headless_use_embedded_resources
    Current value = true
      From //out/Headless/args.gn:16
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //headless/headless.gni:7

    Embed resource.pak file into the binary for easier distribution.

host_byteorder
    Current value (from the default) = "undefined"
      From //build/config/host_byteorder.gni:9

host_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = "x64"
      (Internally set; try `gn help host_cpu`.)

host_os
    Current value (from the default) = "linux"
      (Internally set; try `gn help host_os`.)

host_pkg_config
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:36

    A optional pkg-config wrapper to use for tools built on the host.

host_toolchain
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:148

    This should not normally be set as a build argument.  It's here so that
    every toolchain can pass through the "global" value via toolchain_args().

icu_use_data_file
    Current value = false
      From //out/Headless/args.gn:17
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //third_party/icu/config.gni:15

    Tells icu to load an external data file rather than rely on the icudata
    being linked directly into the binary.

    This flag is a bit confusing. As of this writing, icu.gyp set the value to
    0 but common.gypi sets the value to 1 for most platforms (and the 1 takes
    precedence).

    TODO(GYP) We'll probably need to enhance this logic to set the value to
    true or false in similar circumstances.

ignore_elf32_limitations
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:39

    Android 32-bit non-component, non-clang builds cannot have symbol_level=2
    due to 4GiB file size limit, see https://crbug.com/648948.
    Set this flag to true to skip the assertion.

include_transport_security_state_preload_list
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:40

    Includes the transport security state preload list. This list includes
    mechanisms (e.g. HSTS, HPKP) to enforce trusted connections to a significant
    set of hardcoded domains. While this list has a several hundred KB of binary
    size footprint, this flag should not be disabled unless the embedder is
    willing to take the responsibility to make sure that all important
    connections use HTTPS.

include_vr_data
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:34

    Whether to include VR extras like test APKs in non-VR-specific targets

internal_gles2_conform_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //gpu/gles2_conform_support/BUILD.gn:7

    Set to true to compile with the OpenGL ES 2.0 conformance tests.

internal_khronos_glcts_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //gpu/khronos_glcts_support/BUILD.gn:8

ios_deployment_target
    Current value (from the default) = "11.0"
      From //build/config/ios/ios_sdk_overrides.gni:10

    Version of iOS that we're targeting.

is_asan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:12

    Compile for Address Sanitizer to find memory bugs.

is_cast_audio_only
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:23

    Set this true for an audio-only Chromecast build.

is_cast_desktop_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:39

    True if Chromecast build is targeted for linux desktop. This type of build
    is useful for testing and development, but currently supports only a subset
    of Cast functionality. Though this defaults to true for x86 Linux devices,
    this should be overriden manually for an embedded x86 build.
    TODO(slan): Remove instances of this when x86 is a fully supported platform.

is_cast_using_cma_backend
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:27

    If true, use cast CMA backend instead of default chromium media pipeline.
    TODO(sanfin): Remove this flag when all builds enable CMA.

is_cfi
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:59

    Compile with Control Flow Integrity to protect virtual calls and casts.
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html

    TODO(pcc): Remove this flag if/when CFI is enabled in all official builds.

is_chrome_branded
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chrome_build.gni:9

    Select the desired branding flavor. False means normal Chromium branding,
    true means official Google Chrome branding (requires extra Google-internal
    resources).

is_chromecast
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:11

    Set this true for a Chromecast build. Chromecast builds are supported on
    Linux and Android.

is_clang
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:137

    Set to true when compiling with the Clang compiler.

is_component_build
    Current value = false
      From //out/Headless/args.gn:18
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:165

    Component build. Setting to true compiles targets declared as "components"
    as shared libraries loaded dynamically. This speeds up development time.
    When false, components will be linked statically.

    For more information see
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/component_build.md

is_component_ffmpeg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_options.gni:41

    Set true to build ffmpeg as a shared library. NOTE: this means we should
    always consult is_component_ffmpeg instead of is_component_build for
    ffmpeg targets. This helps linux chromium packagers that swap out our
    ffmpeg.so with their own. See discussion here
    https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/chromium-packagers/R5rcZXWxBEQ/B6k0zzmJbvcJ

is_ct_supported
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //services/network/public/cpp/features.gni:10

    Certificate transparency is not supported on iOS.
    TODO(mmenke): It's actually not supported on Android, either.

is_debug
    Current value = false
      From //out/Headless/args.gn:19
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:155

    Debug build. Enabling official builds automatically sets is_debug to false.

is_desktop_linux
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:134

    Whether we're a traditional desktop unix.

is_hwasan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:17

    Compile for Hardware-Assisted Address Sanitizer to find memory bugs
    (android/arm64 only).
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.html

is_lsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:20

    Compile for Leak Sanitizer to find leaks.

is_msan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:23

    Compile for Memory Sanitizer to find uninitialized reads.

is_multi_dll_chrome
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chrome_build.gni:13

    Break chrome.dll into multple pieces based on process type. Only available
    on Windows.

is_nacl_glibc
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/nacl/config.gni:9

    Native Client supports both Newlib and Glibc C libraries where Newlib
    is assumed to be the default one; use this to determine whether Glibc
    is being used instead.

is_official_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:131

    Set to enable the official build level of optimization. This has nothing
    to do with branding, but enables an additional level of optimization above
    release (!is_debug). This might be better expressed as a tri-state
    (debug, release, official) but for historical reasons there are two
    separate flags.

is_proto_quic
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //net/features.gni:9

    If true, prune things down as needed for proto-quic build.

is_tsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:26

    Compile for Thread Sanitizer to find threading bugs.

is_ubsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:30

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer to find various types of
    undefined behaviour (excludes vptr checks).

is_ubsan_no_recover
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:33

    Halt the program if a problem is detected.

is_ubsan_null
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:36

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer's null pointer checks.

is_ubsan_security
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:89

    Enables core ubsan security features. Will later be removed once it matches
    is_ubsan.

is_ubsan_vptr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:39

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer's vptr checks.

is_unsafe_developer_build
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //base/BUILD.gn:50

    Unsafe developer build. Has developer-friendly features that may weaken or
    disable security measures like sandboxing or ASLR.
    IMPORTANT: Unsafe developer builds should never be distributed to end users.

is_win_fastlink
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:65

    Tell VS to create a PDB that references information in .obj files rather
    than copying it all. This should improve linker performance. mspdbcmf.exe
    can be used to convert a fastlink pdb to a normal one.

jumbo_build_excluded
    Current value (from the default) = []
      From //build/config/jumbo.gni:26

    A list of build targets to exclude from jumbo builds, for optimal
    round trip time when frequently changing a set of cpp files. The
    targets can be just the short name (in which case it matches any
    target with that name), a directory prefixed with the root
    specifier //, or a full build target label.

    Example:
    These would all exclude the "browser" target in a file
    content/browser/BUILD.gn, and potentially more.

    jumbo_build_excluded = [ "browser" ]
    jumbo_build_excluded = [ "//content/browser" ]
    jumbo_build_excluded = [ "//content/browser:browser" ]

jumbo_file_merge_limit
    Current value (from the default) = -1
      From //build/config/jumbo.gni:42

    How many files to group on average. Smaller numbers give more
    parallellism, higher numbers give less total CPU usage. Higher
    numbers also give longer single-file recompilation times.

    Recommendations:
    Higher numbers than 100 does not reduce wall clock compile times
    even for 4 cores or less so no reason to go higher than 100.
    Going from 50 to 100 with a 4 core CPU saves about 3% CPU time and
    3% wall clock time in a tree with blink, v8 and content
    jumbofied. At the same time it increases the compile time for the
    largest jumbo chunks by 10-20% and reduces the chance to use all
    available CPU cores. So set the default to 50 to balance between
    high and low-core build performance. -1 means do the default which
    varies depending on whether goma is enabled.

ldso_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/gcc/BUILD.gn:20

libcxx_abi_unstable
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/c++/BUILD.gn:17

    lldb pretty printing only works when libc++ is built in the __1 (or __ndk1)
    namespaces.  For pretty printing to work out-of-the-box on Mac (where lldb
    is primarily used), this flag is set to false to build with the __1
    namespace (to maintain ABI compatibility, this implies building without
    _LIBCPP_ABI_UNSTABLE).  This is not necessary on non-component builds
    because we leave the ABI version set to __1 in that case because libc++
    symbols are not exported.
    TODO(thomasanderson): Set this to true by default once rL352899 is available
    in MacOS's lldb.

libcxx_is_shared
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:38

    WARNING: Setting this to a non-default value is highly discouraged.
    If true, libc++ will be built as a shared library; otherwise libc++ will be
    linked statically. Setting this to something other than the default is
    unsupported and can be broken by libc++ rolls. Note that if this is set to
    true, you must also set libcxx_abi_unstable=false, which is bad for
    performance and memory use.

libcxx_svn_revision
    Current value (from the default) = "358423"
      From //buildtools/deps_revisions.gni:8

    The libc++ svn revision that belongs to the git hash in DEPS. Used to cause
    full rebuilds on libc++ rolls.

libyuv_disable_jpeg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:15

libyuv_include_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:14

libyuv_symbols_visible
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/BUILD.gn:19

    When building a shared library using a target in WebRTC or
    Chromium projects that depends on libyuv, setting this flag
    to true makes libyuv symbols visible inside that library.

libyuv_use_gflags
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/libyuv/BUILD.gn:14

    Set to false to disable building with gflags.

libyuv_use_mmi
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:22

libyuv_use_msa
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:20

libyuv_use_neon
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:17

link_pulseaudio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:36

    Allows distributions to link pulseaudio directly (DT_NEEDED) instead of
    using dlopen. This helps with automated detection of ABI mismatches and
    prevents silent errors.

linux_use_bundled_binutils
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:57

llvm_force_head_revision
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:18

    If this is set to true, or if LLVM_FORCE_HEAD_REVISION is set to 1
    in the environment, we use the revision in the llvm repo to determine
    the CLANG_REVISION to use, instead of the version hard-coded into
    //tools/clang/scripts/update.py. This should only be used in
    conjunction with setting LLVM_FORCE_HEAD_REVISION in the
    environment when `gclient runhooks` is run as well.

mac_sdk_min
    Current value (from the default) = "10.13"
      From //build/config/mac/mac_sdk_overrides.gni:12

media_use_ffmpeg
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:41

    Enable usage of FFmpeg within the media library. Used for most software
    based decoding, demuxing, and sometimes optimized FFTs. If disabled,
    implementors must provide their own demuxers and decoders.

media_use_libvpx
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:45

    Enable usage of libvpx within the media library. Used for software based
    decoding of VP9 and VP8A type content.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/vr/buildflags/buildflags.gni:52

    When true, portions of VR's native code are included in the VR DFM.

mojo_media_host
    Current value (from the default) = "gpu"
      From //media/media_options.gni:251

    The process that the mojo MediaService runs in. By default, all services
    registered in |mojo_media_services| are hosted in the MediaService, with the
    exception that when |enable_library_cdms| is true, the "cdm" service will
    run in a separate CdmService in the CDM (utility) process, while other
    |mojo_media_services| still run in the MediaService in the process specified
    by "mojo_media_host".
    Valid options are:
    - "none": Do not use mojo media service.
    - "browser": Use mojo media service hosted in the browser process.
    - "gpu": Use mojo media service hosted in the gpu process.
    - "utility": Use mojo media service hosted in the utility process.

mojo_media_services
    Current value (from the default) = ["cdm"]
      From //media/media_options.gni:238

    A list of mojo media services that should be used in the media pipeline.
    Must not be empty if |enable_mojo_media| is true.
    Valid entries in the list are:
    - "renderer": Use mojo-based media Renderer service.
    - "cdm": Use mojo-based Content Decryption Module.
    - "audio_decoder": Use mojo-based audio decoder in the default media
                       Renderer. Cannot be used with the mojo Renderer above.
    - "video_decoder": Use mojo-based video decoder in the default media
                       Renderer. Cannot be used with the mojo Renderer above.

mojom_message_id_salt_path
    Current value (from the default) = "//chrome/VERSION"
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:92

    The path to a file whose contents can be used as the basis for a message
    ID scrambling salt.

mojom_message_id_salt_suffix_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:102

monolithic_binaries
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/BUILD.gn:35

    Only for local development. When true the binaries (perfetto, traced, ...)
    are monolithic and don't use a common shared library. This is mainly to
    avoid LD_LIBRARY_PATH dances when testing locally.

msan_track_origins
    Current value (from the default) = 2
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:44

    Track where uninitialized memory originates from. From fastest to slowest:
    0 - no tracking, 1 - track only the initial allocation site, 2 - track the
    chain of stores leading from allocation site to use site.

ndk_api_level_at_least_26
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/angle/gni/angle.gni:45

optimize_for_fuzzing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:97

    Optimize for coverage guided fuzzing (balance between speed and number of
    branches). Can be also used to remove non-determinism and other issues.

optimize_webui
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //ui/webui/webui_features.gni:9

    Optimize parts of Chrome's UI written with web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS)
    for runtime performance purposes. This does more work at compile time for
    speed benefits at runtime (so we skip in debug builds).

ozone_auto_platforms
    Current value = false
      From //build/args/headless.gn:11
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //ui/ozone/ozone.gni:14

    Select platforms automatically. Turn this off for manual control.

ozone_extra_path
    Current value (from the default) = "//ui/ozone/ozone_extra.gni"

    Ozone extra platforms file path. Can be overridden to build out of
    tree ozone platforms.

ozone_platform
    Current value = "headless"
      From //build/args/headless.gn:12
    Overridden from the default = ""
      From //ui/ozone/ozone.gni:20

    The platform that will used at runtime by default. This can be overridden
    with the command line flag --ozone-platform=<platform>.

      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:16

    Build PDFium either:
    1) When set to true, with a bundled FreeType, built from FreeType source
       code in //third_party/freetype and PDFium's FreeType configs in
       third_party/freetype/include.
    2) When set to false, use whatever FreeType target is defined in
       //build/config/freetype.

pdf_enable_click_logging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:19

    Generate logging messages for click events that reach PDFium

pdf_enable_v8

      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:54

    Build a complete static library

pdf_is_standalone
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:51

    Build PDFium standalone

pdf_use_skia
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:41

    Build PDFium against Skia (experimental) rather than AGG. Use Skia to draw
    everything.

pdf_use_skia_paths
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:45

    Build PDFium against Skia (experimental) rather than AGG. Use Skia to draw
    paths.

pdf_use_win32_gdi
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:48

    Build PDFium with or without experimental win32 GDI APIs.

perfetto_build_with_android
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:48

    The Android blueprint file generator overrides this to true.

perfetto_force_dlog
    Current value (from the default) = "off"
      From //third_party/perfetto/gn/perfetto.gni:74

    Whether DLOG should be enabled on debug builds (""), all builds ("on"), or
    none ("off"). We disable it by default for embedders to avoid spamming their
    console.

pgo_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:66

    Indicates if the build is using PGO.

pgo_data_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/compiler/pgo/pgo.gni:16

    When using chrome_pgo_phase = 2, read profile data from this path.

pkg_config
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:33

    A pkg-config wrapper to call instead of trying to find and call the right
    pkg-config directly. Wrappers like this are common in cross-compilation
    environments.
    Leaving it blank defaults to searching PATH for 'pkg-config' and relying on
    the sysroot mechanism to find the right .pc files.

print_unsymbolized_stack_traces
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //base/third_party/symbolize/BUILD.gn:13

    Stack traces will not include function names. Instead they will contain
    file and offset information that can be used with
    tools/valgrind/asan/asan_symbolize.py. By piping stderr through this script,
    and also enabling symbol_level = 2, you can get much more detailed stack
    traces with file names and line numbers, even in non-ASAN builds.

proprietary_codecs
    Current value = true
      From //out/Headless/args.gn:20
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/features.gni:29

    Enables proprietary codecs and demuxers; e.g. H264, AAC, MP3, and MP4.
    We always build Google Chrome and Chromecast with proprietary codecs.

    Note: this flag is used by WebRTC which is DEPSed into Chrome. Moving it
    out of //build will require using the build_overrides directory.

remove_webcore_debug_symbols
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/blink/renderer/config.gni:25

    DEPRECATED: Use blink_symbol_level=0. https://crbug.com/943869

ro_segment_workaround_for_valgrind
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:118

    Set to true to pass --no-rosegment to lld. This is a workaround
    for a KI issue in Valgrind,
    https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=384727

root_extra_deps
    Current value (from the default) = []
      From //BUILD.gn:39

    checkout to add additional targets without explicitly changing any checked-
    in files.

rtc_audio_device_plays_sinus_tone
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:168

    When set to true, replace the audio output with a sinus tone at 440Hz.
    The ADM will ask for audio data from WebRTC but instead of reading real
    audio samples from NetEQ, a sinus tone will be generated and replace the
    real audio samples.

rtc_build_examples
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:103

    Set this to false to skip building examples.

      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:145

rtc_builtin_ssl_root_certificates
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:65

    Setting this to false will require the API user to pass in their own
    SSLCertificateVerifier to verify the certificates presented from a
    TLS-TURN server. In return disabling this saves around 100kb in the binary.

rtc_enable_android_aaudio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:125

    Enable use of Android AAudio which requires Android SDK 26 or above and

    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:93

    Enable when an external authentication mechanism is used for performing
    packet authentication for RTP packets instead of libsrtp.

rtc_enable_libevent
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:228

rtc_enable_protobuf
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:209

    Enables the use of protocol buffers for debug recordings.

rtc_enable_sctp
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:212

    Set this to disable building with support for SCTP data channels.

rtc_enable_symbol_export
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:41

    Setting this to true will make RTC_EXPORT (see rtc_base/system/rtc_export.h)
    expand to code that will manage symbols visibility.

rtc_exclude_field_trial_default
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:51

    When WebRTC is built as part of Chromium it should exclude the default
    implementation of field_trial unless it is building for NACL or
    Chromecast.

rtc_exclude_metrics_default
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:60

    Setting this to true will define WEBRTC_EXCLUDE_METRICS_DEFAULT which
    will tell the pre-processor to remove the default definition of symbols
    needed to use metrics. In that case a new implementation needs to be
    provided.

rtc_include_builtin_audio_codecs
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:183

    When set to false, builtin audio encoder/decoder factories and all the

    WebRTC.framework)

rtc_include_builtin_video_codecs
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:189

    When set to false, builtin video encoder/decoder factories and all the
    video codecs they depends on will not be included in libwebrtc.{a|lib}
    (they will still be included in libjingle_peerconnection_so.so and
    WebRTC.framework)

rtc_include_ilbc

rtc_include_internal_audio_device
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:241

    Chromium uses its own IO handling, so the internal ADM is only built for
    standalone WebRTC.

rtc_include_opus
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:71

    Disable this to avoid building the Opus audio codec.

rtc_include_pulse_audio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:237

    Excluded in Chromium since its prerequisites don't require Pulse Audio.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:244

    Include tests in standalone checkout.

rtc_jsoncpp_root
    Current value (from the default) = "//third_party/jsoncpp/source/include"
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:82

    Used to specify an external Jsoncpp include path when not compiling the
    library that comes with WebRTC (i.e. rtc_build_json == 0).

rtc_libvpx_build_vp9
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:218

rtc_link_pipewire
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:118

    Set this to link PipeWire directly instead of using the dlopen.

rtc_opus_support_120ms_ptime
    Current value (from the default) = true

    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:137

    Set to "func", "block", "edge" for coverage generation.
    At unit test runtime set UBSAN_OPTIONS="coverage=1".
    It is recommend to set include_examples=0.
    Use llvm's sancov -html-report for human readable reports.
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html .

rtc_ssl_root
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:86

    Used to specify an external OpenSSL include path when not compiling the
    library that comes with WebRTC (i.e. rtc_build_ssl == 0).

rtc_use_dummy_audio_file_devices
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:162

    By default, use normal platform audio support or dummy audio, but don't
    use file-based audio playout and record.

rtc_use_gtk
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:234

    Overridden from the default = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:115

    Set this to use PipeWire on the Wayland display server.
    By default it's only enabled on desktop Linux (excludes ChromeOS) and
    only when using the sysroot as PipeWire is not available in older and
    supported Ubuntu and Debian distributions.

rtc_use_x11
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:109

rtc_win_undef_unicode
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:197

    When set to true and in a standalone build, it will undefine UNICODE and
    _UNICODE (which are always defined globally by the Chromium Windows
    toolchain).
    This is only needed for testing purposes, WebRTC wants to be sure it
    doesn't assume /DUNICODE and /D_UNICODE but that it explicitly uses
    wide character functions.

runtime_call_stats_count_everything
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/blink/renderer/platform/BUILD.gn:220

safe_browsing_mode
    Current value (from the default) = 1
      From //build/config/features.gni:44

sample_profile_is_accurate
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:101

    Whether we should consider the profile we're using to be accurate. Accurate
    profiles have the benefit of (potentially substantial) binary size
    reductions, by instructing the compiler to optimize cold and uncovered
    functions heavily for size. This often comes at the cost of performance.

sanitizer_coverage_flags
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:107

    Value for -fsanitize-coverage flag. Setting this causes
    use_sanitizer_coverage to be enabled.
    This flag is not used for libFuzzer (use_libfuzzer=true). Instead, we use:
        -fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link
    Default value when unset and use_fuzzing_engine=true:
        trace-pc-guard
    Default value when unset and use_sanitizer_coverage=true:
        trace-pc-guard,indirect-calls

      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:193

strip_debug_info
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:40

    Android-only: Strip the debug info of libraries within lib.unstripped to
    reduce size. As long as symbol_level > 0, this will still allow stacks to be
    symbolized.

support_webgl2_compute_context
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/blink/renderer/config.gni:45

    If true, webgl2-compute context will be supported.

symbol_level
    Current value = 0
      From //out/Headless/args.gn:21
    Overridden from the default = -1
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:35

    How many symbols to include in the build. This affects the performance of
    the build since the symbols are large and dealing with them is slow.
      2 means regular build with symbols.
      1 means minimal symbols, usually enough for backtraces only. Symbols with
    internal linkage (static functions or those in anonymous namespaces) may not
    appear when using this level.
      0 means no symbols.
      -1 means auto-set according to debug/release and platform.

sync_user_agent_product
    Current value (from the default) = "Chrome"
      From //components/sync/driver/BUILD.gn:11

    Controls the product part of the user agent calculated in sync_util.cc.

system_libdir
    Current value (from the default) = "lib"
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:47

    CrOS systemroots place pkgconfig files at <systemroot>/usr/share/pkgconfig
    and one of <systemroot>/usr/lib/pkgconfig or <systemroot>/usr/lib64/pkgconfig
    depending on whether the systemroot is for a 32 or 64 bit architecture.

    When build under GYP, CrOS board builds specify the 'system_libdir' variable
    as part of the GYP_DEFINES provided by the CrOS emerge build or simple
    chrome build scheme. This variable permits controlling this for GN builds
    in similar fashion by setting the `system_libdir` variable in the build's
    args.gn file to 'lib' or 'lib64' as appropriate for the target architecture.

target_cpu
    Current value = "x64"
      From //out/Headless/args.gn:22
    Overridden from the default = ""
      (Internally set; try `gn help target_cpu`.)

target_os
    Current value = "linux"

treat_warnings_as_errors
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:46

    Default to warnings as errors for default workflow, where we catch
    warnings with known toolchains. Allow overriding this e.g. for Chromium
    builds on Linux that could use a different version of the compiler.
    With GCC, warnings in no-Chromium code are always not treated as errors.

trial_comparison_cert_verifier_supported
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:44

    Platforms where the cert verifier comparison trial is supported.

    Enable checks for indirect function calls via a function pointer.
    TODO(pcc): remove this when we're ready to add these checks by default.
    https://crbug.com/701919

use_cfi_recover
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:78

    Let Control Flow Integrity continue execution instead of crashing when
    printing diagnostics (use_cfi_diag = true).

use_clang_coverage
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/coverage/coverage.gni:15

    Enable Clang's Source-based Code Coverage.

    Overridden from the default = true
      From //printing/buildflags/buildflags.gni:23

use_custom_libcxx
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:14

use_custom_libcxx_for_host
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:24

    Use libc++ instead of stdlibc++ when using the host_cpu toolchain, even if
    use_custom_libcxx is false. This is useful for cross-compiles where a custom
    toolchain for the target_cpu has been set as the default toolchain, but
    use_custom_libcxx should still be true when building for the host.  The
    expected usage is to set use_custom_libcxx=false and
    use_custom_libcxx_for_host=true in the passed in buildargs.

use_cxx11
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:97

      From //build/config/features.gni:50

use_debug_fission
    Current value (from the default) = "default"
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:56

    use_debug_fission: whether to use split DWARF debug info
    files. This can reduce link time significantly, but is incompatible
    with some utilities such as icecc and ccache. Requires gold and
    gcc >= 4.8 or clang.
    http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission

    This is a placeholder value indicating that the code below should set
    the default.  This is necessary to delay the evaluation of the default
    value expression until after its input values such as use_gold have
    been set, e.g. by a toolchain_args() block.

use_dummy_lastchange
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/util/lastchange.gni:9

use_egl

    includes GMS which provides the GCM client.

use_ghash
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:122

    Turn this on to use ghash feature of lld for faster debug link on Windows.

use_icf
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:156

    Set to true to use icf, Identical Code Folding.

    icf=all is broken in older golds, see
    https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17704
    See also https://crbug.com/663886
    `linux_use_bundled_binutils` is to avoid breaking Linux distros which may
    still have a buggy gold.
    chromeos binutils has been patched with the fix, so always use icf there.
    The bug only affects x86 and x64, so we can still use ICF when targeting
    other architectures.

    lld doesn't have the bug.

    Overridden from the default = true
      From //net/features.gni:23

    Enable Kerberos authentication. It is disabled by default on iOS, Fuchsia
    and Chromecast, at least for now. This feature needs configuration
    (krb5.conf and so on).
    TODO(fuchsia): Enable kerberos on Fuchsia when it's implemented there.

use_official_google_api_keys
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:31

    You can set the variable 'use_official_google_api_keys' to true
    to use the Google-internal file containing official API keys
    for Google Chrome even in a developer build.  Setting this
    variable explicitly to true will cause your build to fail if the
    internal file is missing.

    The variable is documented here, but not handled in this file;
    see //google_apis/determine_use_official_keys.gypi for the
    implementation.

    Set the variable to false to not use the internal file, even when
    it exists in your checkout.

    Leave it unset or set to "" to have the variable
    implicitly set to true if you have
    src/google_apis/internal/google_chrome_api_keys.h in your
    checkout, and implicitly set to false if not.

    Note that official builds always behave as if the variable
    was explicitly set to true, i.e. they always use official keys,
    and will fail to build if the internal file is missing.

    but some sanitizers are known to require it, like CFI diagnostics
    and UBsan variants.

use_sanitizer_configs_without_instrumentation
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:115

      From //build/config/freetype/freetype.gni:13

    Blink needs a recent and properly build-configured FreeType version to
    support OpenType variations, color emoji and avoid security bugs. By default
    we ship and link such a version as part of Chrome. For distributions that
    prefer to keep linking to the version the system, FreeType must be newer
    than version 2.7.1 and have color bitmap support compiled in. WARNING:
    System FreeType configurations other than as described WILL INTRODUCE TEXT
    RENDERING AND SECURITY REGRESSIONS.

use_system_harfbuzz
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/harfbuzz-ng/harfbuzz.gni:11

    Blink uses a cutting-edge version of Harfbuzz; most Linux distros do not
    contain a new enough version of the code to work correctly. However,
    ChromeOS chroots (i.e, real ChromeOS builds for devices) do contain a
    new enough version of the library, and so this variable exists so that
    ChromeOS can build against the system lib and keep binary sizes smaller.

    that we want to have it generate for an architecture that is different
    than the architecture that v8 will actually run on; we then run the
    code under an emulator. For example, we might run v8 on x86, but
    generate arm code and run that under emulation.

    This arg is defined here rather than in the v8 project because we want
    some of the common architecture-specific args (like arm_float_abi or
    mips_arch_variant) to be set to their defaults either if the current_cpu
    applies *or* if the v8_current_cpu applies.

    As described below, you can also specify the v8_target_cpu to use
    indirectly by specifying a `custom_toolchain` that contains v8_$cpu in the
    name after the normal toolchain.

    For example, `gn gen --args="custom_toolchain=...:clang_x64_v8_arm64"`
    is equivalent to setting --args=`v8_target_cpu="arm64"`. Setting
    `custom_toolchain` is more verbose but makes the toolchain that is
    (effectively) being used explicit.

    v8_target_cpu can only be used to target one architecture in a build,
    so if you wish to build multiple copies of v8 that are targeting
    different architectures, you will need to do something more
    complicated involving multiple toolchains along the lines of
    custom_toolchain, above.

v8_typed_array_max_size_in_heap
    Current value (from the default) = 64
      From //v8/BUILD.gn:159

    Controls the threshold for on-heap/off-heap Typed Arrays.

v8_untrusted_code_mitigations
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //v8/BUILD.gn:181

v8_use_external_startup_data
    Current value = false
      From //build/args/headless.gn:30
    Overridden from the default = ""
      From //v8/gni/v8.gni:52

    Use external files for startup data blobs:
    the JS builtins sources and the start snapshot.

v8_use_mips_abi_hardfloat
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //v8/BUILD.gn:156

    Similar to the ARM hard float ABI but on MIPS.

v8_use_multi_snapshots
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //v8/gni/v8.gni:48

    Enable several snapshots side-by-side (e.g. default and for trusted code).

v8_use_perfetto
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //v8/BUILD.gn:144

    Use Perfetto (https://perfetto.dev) as the default TracingController. Not
    currently implemented.

v8_use_siphash
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //v8/BUILD.gn:140

    Use Siphash as added protection against hash flooding attacks.

v8_use_snapshot
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //v8/gni/v8.gni:44

    Enable the snapshot feature, for fast context creation.
    https://v8.dev/blog/custom-startup-snapshots
    TODO(thakis): Make snapshots work in 64-bit win/cross builds,
    https://803591
    On Mac hosts, 32-bit builds targeting Windows can't use snapshots, see
    https://crbug.com/794838

v8_win64_unwinding_info
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //v8/BUILD.gn:95

    Enable the registration of unwinding info for Windows/x64.

win_console_app
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/console_app.gni:12

    If true, builds as a console app (rather than a windowed app), which allows
    logging to be printed to the user. This will cause a terminal window to pop
    up when the executable is not run from the command line, so should only be
    used for development. Only has an effect on Windows builds.
